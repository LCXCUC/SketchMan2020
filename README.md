SketchMan: Learning To Create Professional Sketches

This is a instructions for use of SketchMan dataset, which will be publicly available soon.
We have provided the approximate professional NPS and the free-hand NPS.
Unfortunately, we cannot directly provide the professional sketch images since we do not own them. Alternatively, we provide the selected colored sketch ID in our paper.
Please refer to the file colored_sketch_pair.csv for more details in https://github.com/jerryli27/pixiv_dataset.
Once you have obtained the original and colored PS, the grayscale PS and the background mask can be produced via specific CV algorithms. 
Moreover, the corner points, straight lines and abstract contour can be extracted by means of the methods introduced in our paper.
